"Every piece of data in Security Force Monitor has at least one source. "
"Confidence scores are given to every piece of data from the Monitor's "
"research with the exception of data related to alleged ``incidents.``\\ "
"This is because event data is a repetition of allegations made by other "
"organizations without any judgement as to the validity of those "
"allegations by the Monitor."

"Confidence scores are determined first by agreement amongst sources about"
" the overall structure and nature of the security forces. Sources for "
"this type of information generally are laws of the country, government "
"websites, and books. For example, if the law states that police force is "
"divided into Police Divisions and Police Stations and a Monitor "
"researcher comes across a source that references a particular Police "
"Division, we would accept that source with ``Low`` confidence as this "
"conforms with what other sources state about the structure of the police."
" Conversely, if a Monitor researcher came across a source that referenced"
" a \"Police Command Zone\" they would need to do more research before "
"publishing information on this potential organization, as \"Police "
"Command Zone\" does not fit into what other sources state about the "
"structure of the police. This could mean the other sources are incorrect,"
" or that a change has occurred in the structure of the police force, or "
"simply that this is a formation not referenced by the Monitor's other "
"sources. Additional research would help clarify the situation."
