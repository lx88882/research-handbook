"Incidents are publicly-documented allegations of acts committed by state-"
"controlled security forces that may violate human rights laws and standards,"
" international criminal law and other sets of relevant norms. Incidents may "
"include extrajudicial killings, rape, torture and other forms of violence. "
"Security Force Monitor does not make these allegations itself, but compiles "
"allegations made by governmental bodies, human rights organizations and "
"other civil society actors around the world."

"The Security Force Monitor focuses its research on the structure, personnel "
"and operations of security forces; we do not directly investigate specific "
"allegations of human rights abuse in the way that Amnesty International or "
"Human Rights Watch do. As such we consider all reports of human rights "
"abuses as “alleged” in our documentation. This simply means these are claims"
" that other organizations have made and which we are repeating without "
"further verification. The Security Force Monitor does not make allegations "
"against security forces and the data that we publish does not attempt to "
"demonstrate involvement of individuals or units in human rights abuses "
"beyond that which other organizations have alleged."

"In a departure from how we compile data about :doc:`units` and "
":doc:`persons`, individual fields in incident records are not sourced and "
"rated for confidence. Rather, we provide a single source for the entire "
"incident. This is because each incident is a direct copy of material from a "
"single source rather than a tapestry of material from a range of different "
"sources."

"According to Amnesty International: \"On 1 May 2012, around midnight, "
"Nigerian soldiers arrested 37-year-old Dungus Ladan (not his real name), at "
"his home in Maiduguri. Fatima, Dungus’ wife, told Amnesty International that"
" the soldiers promised to just take him for an interrogation that should not"
" last more than a few hours. When her husband did not return, she said, his "
"father went on 3 May to Giwa barracks to check what had happened. Soldiers "
"told him that Dungus had already been released. When he still did not "
"return, the father went back again to the barracks, where soldiers told him "
"that he should come back the next day to bail out his son. The following "
"day, several relatives went together and gave the soldiers “what they "
"could,” and the soldiers again promised to release Dungus that day. His wife"
" said that the soldiers kept asking for money, and the family kept paying, "
"but Dungus was never released. In February 2014, his father saw Dungus in "
"the detention facility; they spoke briefly. Dungus said he had been framed "
"by some people who owed him money and they arranged for him to be arrested "
"and detained. Since then, his family has not seen him again; soldiers at "
"Giwa barracks have told them he is not there.\""
