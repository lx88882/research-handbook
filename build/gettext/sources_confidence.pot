msgid "Every piece of data in Security Force Monitor has at least one source. Confidence scores are given to every piece of data from the Monitor's research with the exception of data related to alleged ``incidents.``\\ This is because event data is a repetition of allegations made by other organizations without any judgement as to the validity of those allegations by the Monitor."

msgid "Confidence scores are determined first by agreement amongst sources about the overall structure and nature of the security forces. Sources for this type of information generally are laws of the country, government websites, and books. For example, if the law states that police force is divided into Police Divisions and Police Stations and a Monitor researcher comes across a source that references a particular Police Division, we would accept that source with ``Low`` confidence as this conforms with what other sources state about the structure of the police. Conversely, if a Monitor researcher came across a source that referenced a \"Police Command Zone\" they would need to do more research before publishing information on this potential organization, as \"Police Command Zone\" does not fit into what other sources state about the structure of the police. This could mean the other sources are incorrect, or that a change has occurred in the structure of the police force, or simply that this is a formation not referenced by the Monitor's other sources. Additional research would help clarify the situation."
