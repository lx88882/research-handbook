These are sources that contain a sufficiently large amount or complex type of data that technical help is necessary to extract it in a timely way; doing the work “by hand” is possible, but would be slow and error prone. These high value data extraction tasks use techniques such as web-scraping, scripted parsing and geospatial analysis. An example of these types of sources are the `Internet Archive snapshots the official webpage of the Mexican Army and Air Force <https://web.archive.org/web/20050908175401/http://www.sedena.gob.mx/ejercito/comandancias/index.html>`__ (and child pages) going back more than a decade which outline the top level structures of the Mexican army and its commanding officers."

msgid "For example, the Monitor's scoping research on Nigeria revealed that by law every state and the federal territory has a Police Command. By extension this means since 1996 (when the last states of Nigeria were created) there have been 37 Police Commands. Statistics from the Nigeria Police Force show that between 2007 and 2012 most Police Commands were in charge of 2 to 3 Police Area Commands (though some heavily populated states have more, with Lagos having the most at 8). These statistics also show that on average each state and the federal capital territory had 30 Police Divisions, which by law are generally under the command of a Police Area Command. Thus, from a few initial sources a Monitor researcher can have a general sense of the structure of the police and a useful metric to compare the Monitor’s dataset against."
